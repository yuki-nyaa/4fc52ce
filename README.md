"The regex-centric, fast and flexible lexical analyzer generator for C++"

Flex reimagined.  Fast, flexible, adds Boost ðŸ’ª

[RE/flex][reflex-url] is faster than Flex while providing a wealth of new
features.  RE/flex is also much faster than regex libraries such as
Boost.Regex, C++11 std::regex, PCRE2 and RE2.  For example, tokenizing a
representative C source code file into 244 tokens takes only 13 microseconds:

<table>
<tr><th>Command / Function</th><th>Software</th><th>Time (Î¼s)</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>reflex --fast</b></td><td><b>RE/flex</b></td><td><b>13</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>flex -+ --full</td><td>Flex</td><td>17</td></tr>
<tr><td>reflex --full</td><td>RE/flex</td><td>29</td></tr>
<tr><td>boost::spirit::lex::lexertl::actor_lexer::iterator_type</td><td>Boost.Spirit.Lex</td><td>40</td></tr>
<tr><td>reflex -m=boost-perl</td><td>Boost.Regex</td><td>230</td></tr>
<tr><td>pcre2_match()</td><td>PCRE2 (pre-compiled)</td><td>318</td></tr>
<tr><td>reflex -m=boost</td><td>Boost.Regex POSIX mode</td><td>450</td></tr>
<tr><td>flex -+</td><td>Flex</td><td>3968</td></tr>
<tr><td>RE2::Consume()</td><td>RE2 (pre-compiled)</td><td>5088</td></tr>
<tr><td>RE2::Consume()</td><td>RE2 POSIX mode (pre-compiled)</td><td>5420</td></tr>
<tr><td>std::cregex_iterator()</td><td>C++11 std::regex</td><td>14784</td></tr>
</table>

Note: *Best times of 10 tests with average time in microseconds over 100 runs
(using clang 8.0.0 with -O2, 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3).*


Features
--------

- Compatible with Flex to eliminate a learning curve, making a transition to
  RE/flex frustration-free.
- Includes many examples, such as a tokenizer for C/C++ code, a tokenizer for
  Python code, a tokenizer for Java code, and more.
- Works with Bison and supports reentrant, bison-bridge, bison-locations and
  Bison 3.0 C++ interface `%skeleton "lalr1.cc"`.
- Extensive documentation in the online [User Guide][manual-url].
- Adds Unicode support with Unicode property matching `\p{C}` and C++11, Java,
  C#, and Python Unicode properties for identifier name matching.
- Adds indent/nodent/dedent anchors to match text with indentation, including
  `\t` (tab) adjustments.
- Adds lazy quantifiers to the POSIX regular expression syntax, so hacks are
  no longer needed to work around greedy repetitions in Flex.
- Adds word boundary anchors to the POSIX regular expression syntax.
- Adds an extensible hierarchy of pattern matcher engines, with a choice of
  regex engines, including the RE/flex regex engine and Boost.Regex.
- Adds freespace mode option to improve readability of lexer specifications.
- Adds `%class` and `%init` to customize the generated Lexer classes.
- Adds `%include` to modularize lexer specifications.
- Generates clean source code that defines an MT-safe (reentrant) C++ Lexer
  class derived from an abstract lexer class template, parameterized by matcher
  class type.
- Multiple lexer classes can be combined and used in one application.
- Configurable Lexer class generation to customize the interface for various
  parsers, including Yacc and Bison.
- Generates scanners for lexical analysis on files, C++ streams, and (wide)
  strings, with automatic fast conversion of UTF-16/32 to UTF-8 for matching
  Unicode on UTF-encoded input files.
- Generates lex.yy.cpp files while Flex generates lex.yy.cc files (in C++ mode
  with flex option -+), to distinguish the generated files.
- Generates Graphviz files to visualize FSMs with the Graphviz dot tool.
- Conversion of regex expressions, for regex engines that lack regex features.
- The RE/flex regex library makes C++11 std::regex and Boost.Regex much easier
  to use in plain C++ code for pattern matching on (wide) strings, files, and
  streams.

The RE/flex software is fully self-contained.  No other libraries are required.
Boost.Regex is optional to use as a regex engine.

The RE/flex repo includes tokenizers for Java, Python, and C/C++.


Installation
------------

### Windows users

Use `reflex/bin/reflex.exe` from the command line or add a **Custom Build
Step** in MSVC++ as follows:

1. select the project name in **Solution Explorer** then **Property Pages**
   from the **View** menu (see also
   [custom-build steps in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hefydhhy.aspx));

2. add an extra path to the `reflex/include` folder in the **Include
   Directories** under **VC++ Directories**, which should look like
   `$(VC_IncludePath);$(WindowsSDK_IncludePath);C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\reflex\include`
   (this assumes the `reflex` source package is in your **Documents** folder).

3. enter `"C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\reflex\bin\reflex.exe" --header-file
   "C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\mylexer.l"` in the **Command Line** property
   under **Custom Build Step** (this assumes `mylexer.l` is in your
   **Documents** folder);

4. enter `lex.yy.h lex.yy.cpp` in the **Outputs** property;

5. specify **Execute Before** as `PreBuildEvent`.

If you are using specific reflex options such as `--flex` then add these in step 3.

Before compiling your program with MSVC++, drag the folders `reflex/lib` and
`reflex/unicode` to the **Source Files** in the **Solution Explorer** panel of
your project.  Next, run `reflex.exe` simply by compiling your project (which
may fail, but that is OK for now as long as we executed the custom build step
to run `reflex.exe`).  Drag the generated `lex.yy.h` and `lex.yy.cpp` files to
the **Source Files**.  Now you are all set!

In addition, the `reflex/vs` directory contains batch scripts to build projects
with MS Visual Studio C++.

### Unix/Linux and Mac OS X

On Mac OS X you can use [homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install RE/flex with
`brew install re-flex`.  Otherwise:

You have two options: 1) quick install or 2) configure and make.

### Quick install

First clone the code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Genivia/RE-flex

Then simply do a quick clean build, assuming your environment is pretty much
standard:

    $ ./clean.sh
    $ ./build.sh

This compiles the **reflex** tool and installs it locally in `reflex/bin`.  For
local use of RE/flex in your project, you can add this location to your `$PATH`
variable to enable the new `reflex` command:

    $ export PATH=$PATH:/your_path_to_reflex/reflex/bin

Note that the `libreflex.a` and `libreflex.so` libraries are saved locally in
`reflex/lib`.  Link against the library when you use the RE/flex regex engine
in your code, such as:

    $ c++ <options and .o/.cpp files> -L/your_path_to_reflex/reflex/lib -lreflex

or you could statically link libreflex.a with:

    $ c++ <options and .o/.cpp files> /your_path_to_reflex/reflex/lib/libreflex.a

Also note that the RE/flex header files that you will need to include in your
project are locally located in `include/reflex`.

To fully install the library and the `reflex` command in `/usr/local/lib` and
`/usr/local/bin`:

    $ sudo ./allinstall.sh

Or use the `make -f Make install` command to do the same:

    $ cd lib; sudo make -f Make install
    $ cd src; sudo make -f Make install

### Configure and make

The configure script accepts configuration and installation options.  To view
these options, run:

    $ ./configure --help

Run configure and make:

    $ ./configure && make

After this successfully completes, you can optionally run `make install` to
install the `reflex` command and `libreflex` library:

    $ sudo make install

Unfortunately, cloning from Git does not preserve timestamps which means that
you may run into "WARNING: 'aclocal-1.15' is missing on your system."  To
work around this problem, run:

    $ autoreconf -fi
    $ ./configure && make

### Optional libraries to install

- To use Boost.Regex as a regex engine with the RE/flex library and scanner
  generator, install [Boost][boost-url] and link your code against
  `libboost_regex.a`

- To visualize the FSM graphs generated with **reflex** option `--graphs-file`,
  install [Graphviz dot][dot-url].


Usage
-----

There are two ways you can use this project:

1. as a scanner generator for C++, similar to Flex;
2. as an extensible regex matching library for C++.

For the first option, simply build the **reflex** tool and run it on the
command line on a lexer specification:

    $ reflex --flex --bison --graphs-file lexspec.l

This generates a scanner for Bison from the lexer specification `lexspec.l` and
saves the finite state machine (FSM) as a Graphviz `.gv` file that can be
visualized with the [Graphviz dot][dot-url] tool:

    $ dot -Tpdf reflex.INITIAL.gv > reflex.INITIAL.pdf
    $ open reflex.INITIAL.pdf

![Visualize DFA graphs with Graphviz dot][FSM-url]

Several examples are included to get you started.  See the [manual][manual-url]
for more details.

For the second option, simply use the new RE/flex matcher classes to start
pattern matching on strings, wide strings, files, and streams.

You can select matchers that are based on different regex engines:

- RE/flex regex: `#include <reflex/matcher.h>` and use `reflex::Matcher`;
- Boost.Regex: `#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h>` and use
  `reflex::BoostMatcher` or `reflex::BoostPosixMatcher`;
- C++11 std::regex: `#include <reflex/stdmatcher.h>` and use
  `reflex::StdMatcher` or `reflex::StdPosixMatcher`.

Each matcher may differ in regex syntax features (see the full documentation),
but they have the same methods and iterators:

- `matches()` returns nonzero if the input matches the specified pattern;
- `find()` search input and returns nonzero if a match was found;
- `scan()` scan input and returns nonzero if input at current position matches;
- `split()` returns nonzero for a split of the input at the next match;
- `find.begin()`...`find.end()` filter iterator;
- `scan.begin()`...`scan.end()` tokenizer iterator;
- `split.begin()`...`split.end()` splitter iterator.

For example:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
// use a BoostMatcher to check if the birthdate string is a valid date
if (reflex::BoostMatcher("\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}", birthdate).matches() != 0)
  std::cout << "Valid date!" << std::endl;
```

With a group capture to fetch the year:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
// use a BoostMatcher to check if the birthdate string is a valid date
reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("(\\d{4})-\\d{2}-\\d{2}", birthdate);
if (matcher.matches() != 0)
  std::cout << std::string(matcher[1].first, matcher[1].second) << " was a good year!" << std::endl;
```

To search a string for words `\w+`:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
// use a BoostMatcher to search for words in a sentence
reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.");
while (matcher.find() != 0)
  std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
```

The `split` method is roughly the inverse of the `find` method and returns text
located between matches.  For example using non-word matching `\W+`:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
// use a BoostMatcher to search for words in a sentence
reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("\\W+", "How now brown cow.");
while (matcher.split())
  std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
```

To pattern match the content of a file that may use UTF-8, 16, or 32
encodings:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
// use a BoostMatcher to search and display words from a FILE
FILE *fd = fopen("somefile.txt", "r");
if (fd == NULL)
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("\\w+", fd);
while (matcher.find())
  std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
fclose(fd);
```

Same again, but this time with a C++ input stream:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
// use a BoostMatcher to search and display words from a stream
std::ifstream file("somefile.txt", std::ifstream::in);
reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("\\w+", file);
while (matcher.find())
  std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
file.close();
```

Stuffing the search results into a container using RE/flex iterators:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
#include <vector>         // std::vector
// use a BoostMatcher to convert words of a sentence into a string vector
reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.");
std::vector<std::string> words(matcher.find.begin(), matcher.find.end());
```

Use C++11 range-based loops with RE/flex iterators:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/stdmatcher.h> // reflex::StdMatcher, reflex::Input, std::regex
// use a StdMatcher with std::regex to to search for words in a sentence
for (auto& match : reflex::StdMatcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.").find)
  std::cout << "Found " << match.text() << std::endl;
```

RE/flex also allows you to convert expressive regex syntax forms such as `\p`
Unicode classes, character class set operations such as `[a-z--[aeiou]]`,
escapes such as `\X`, and `(?x)` mode modifiers, to a regex string that the
underlying regex library understands and will be able to use:

- `std::string reflex::Matcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
- `std::string reflex::BoostMatcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
- `std::string reflex::StdMatcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`

For example:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/matcher.h> // reflex::Matcher, reflex::Input, reflex::Pattern
// use a Matcher to check if sentence is in Greek:
static const reflex::Pattern pattern(reflex::Matcher::convert("[\\p{Greek}\\p{Zs}\\pP]+", reflex::convert_flag::unicode));
if (reflex::Matcher(pattern, sentence).matches() != 0)
  std::cout << "This is Greek" << std::endl;
```

We use `convert` with optional flag `reflex::convert_flag::unicode` to make `.`
(dot), `\w`, `\s` and so on match Unicode and to convert `\p` Unicode character
classes.

Conversion is fast (it runs in linear time in the size of the regex), but it is
not without some overhead.  Making converted regex patterns `static` as shown
above saves the cost of conversion to just once to support many matchings.
